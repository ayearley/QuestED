It is not uncommon for people leaving the Transplant Tundra to have pain, nausea,and fevers after such a battle against Leukemia’s minions. I am going to give you these medicines to make you feel better. First, I’m going to give you some medications through your Central Line. Make sure you keep taking your vitamins as well throughout your journey - these will be important in keeping you healthy.”
