*CADEUCES*:
Radiation is another therapy that doctors can give to their patients to kill cancer cells. Radiation is medicine in the form of a light beam or laser beam. You cannot see it or feel it. When the laser or light beam of radiation is delivered into a part of the body, it helps to break up the sick spots. This can be given to the outside of your body, which doctors call external radiation therapy. A person may also receive therapy radiation that the doctor puts directly into your body called internal radiation therapy. Before your radiation therapy even begins, the doctor is going to do a test round. During this you will lay on an x-ray table, so the doctor can decide where exactly the radiation therapy must go. They will mark this with marker. Be sure to not wipe the marker off. The radiation therapy itself  will only last a few minutes although you will have to go back multiple times. You may feel sick when you are getting radiation therapy, but that means the therapy is working. You may see your hair fall out, see a rash on your skin, feel nauseous, throw up, or have diarrhea. If you experience any of these, let your doctor know so they can help you to feel better.
