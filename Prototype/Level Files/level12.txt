7 - Chemotherapy Canyon

*PRE-INTRO*:
We now must continue on to Chemotherapy Canyon. Chemotherapy Canyon is deep, with rock layers so old that they contain rock that exists nowhere else in Panacea. These rocks are used by the potion makers in the canyon to mix their magical potions. Come look over the top of the cliff. Do                   you see the cliff divers in the distance? These are the potion makers who will dive on their dragons into the depths of the canyons. The fire of the dragon is able to melt away the thick layers of rock, and it will leave them with precious gems and rocks. These potion makers live in caves with their dragons that they made themselves. When someone is in need of a potion, they will cast a spell on the potion that magically will transport it to the person in need within in a series of seconds. That is pretty cool isn’t it?!

*CHARACTER*:
doctor: The ancient rock we need for our potion is called Keemo. It is known to be use to stop the growth of sick cells in the body. This ancient rock is the hardest of them all to find. The great wizard has not had success finding any Keemo for his potion, which is why he made it our job to do so. This is key for our potion to reverse the spell on Leukemia. Without this rock, we won’t be able to make our potion, but not to worry because I know you are the right person for the job and will find the magic rock.
