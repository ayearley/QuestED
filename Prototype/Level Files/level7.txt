11 - Physical Therapist

*PRE-INTRO*:
The dragon trainer was raised in the Transplant Tundra which is where all the dragons come from. In the Tundra, dragons are hatched, grown, and when they are old enough, brought to the Capitol, where the trainer trains them to be great warriors to protect the kingdom and help with all types of things, from transporting goods to far off lands, to helping in the fields. The dragon trainer works every day with the dragons, teaching them to run fast and breathe fire, to be strong.
