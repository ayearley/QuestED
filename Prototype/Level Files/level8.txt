3 - Pretransplant

*PRE-INTRO*:
Now that we have met everyone who can help you along this journey, let’s see how we can reverse this spell on Count Leukemia and save Panacea. We will travel to all parts in the kingdom to collect ingredients for a magical potion for the great wizard to use. The wizard who cast this spell on Leukemia when he was a child is the one who must reverse the spell. The wizard has been unable to find all the ingredients for the potion that he needs to make in order for Leukemia to be healed and for the kingdom to go back to normal. You must visit all the lands, and find the right ingredients so that you can give the wizard all the ingredients he needs to make this potion. This will require going through all the different lands of Panacea and meeting all of Panacea’s beloved people.                         Ready to get started?

*CHARACTER*:
doctor: Let’s start in the Capital of Panacea to see how your body is doing to start!  There are a lot of different tests that will prepare you for this journey, and I know it can be confusing or overwhelming at times, so ask me questions anytime as we prepare you. The Capital of Panacea is where the King and Queen live as well as all the other people in our government. As you walk down the streets, you can see everyone busy at work. Right now, we are hosting other villagers at our Town Hall to make a plan on how we are going to get all the ingredients we need for the potion to help Leukemia. Our best map makers, travel experts, and potion makers have all joined forces. They are the ones that have given me the map you see on your homescreen. They have told me exactly what we need to find from each different location, so let’s get to work. If you follow me though, we will go the preparation center which is where we send anyone helping the King and Queen to make sure they are ready for their journey.  There are a lot of different tests that will prepare you for this journey, and I know it can be confusing or overwhelming at times, so ask me questions anytime as we prepare you.
