8 - Transplant Tundra

*PRE-INTRO*:
Now we are off to the Transplant Tundra. The Tundra was a land ruled by both humans and dragons. This cold, icy land was where the factory would take old dragon bones and turn them into materials to make new dragon eggs. This is the dragon birthing center. As you walk around, you can see many baby dragons being born right now. Training a dragon is hard work. We have to teach it to fly, to blow fire only when we need, and train it on its new job. As you have seen, dragons have many jobs where we come from.

*INTRO*:
*CHARACTER*:
doctor: The unfortunate part is that the workers here have stopped going to the factory, and now no new dragons are being hatched. For our potion, we need to find the old bones of the most ancient dragon Marro. If we can find these bones, we will be able to add them to our potion, and we will be one step closer to delivering it to the wizard. Are you up for the challenge? The entire Tundra has been infected by Leukemiaâ€™s minions but we can save the land by planting a cure - bone marrow. In this game, you must get the bone marrow to the bottom of the screen in order to cure the village.
