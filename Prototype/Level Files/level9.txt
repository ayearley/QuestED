4 - Central Line

*PRE-INTRO*:
One of the great travel experts in Panacea has given me a magic pendant that he used to take with him as he traveled many oceans, mountains, deserts, and valleys. I am now going to give it to you. The most important tool you need to have with you this whole time is this magical pendant called a Central Line. In times of trouble, this pendant will help you get a boost - if you’re injured, it will deliver nutrients to your body to make you feel strong again. You must remember to never take it off and keep it close to your heart, for this is where it delivers its power. I can only give this pendant to special warriors like yourself, so let’s better understand this power I am giving you.
