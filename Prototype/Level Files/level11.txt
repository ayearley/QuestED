*CHARACTER*:

doctor: What is the story of these starflies at Radiation River you ask? Long ago, before there was fire and electricity to light the night, the people of Panacea would capture these bugs in their lanterns. They called them starflies because of the way they looked like stars in the black night sky. The people soon learned that these bugs were not only sources of light and warmth, but exuded a radiance that could heal people. Ancient doctors would shine the light of a starfly on the sick or hurt spots, and somehow it would heal the wound.
