9 - NURSE

*PRE-INTRO*:
Unibrow the unicorn is beloved by the entire kingdom, and knows all about everything in Panacea. Whenever the villagers have questions, they ask Unibrow for help. Unibrow flies through the villages on a daily basis, helping the villagers with anything they need. They care for children and elderly people and everyone in between. As you embark on this journey, Unibrow the unicorn can help you at any point. We understand that our village works differently than yours. There are dragons flying over head and magic brimming in the air. This can be overwhelming, so always just find Unibrow the unicorn if you need help. One time, Unibrow the unicorn helped a young girl who accidentally cast a spell on herself that made her grow fairy wings. While she liked flying, she was scared the wings were permanent. She asked Unibrow the unicorn for help, and Unibrow the unicorn was able to give her a potion so that her wings were no longer there. Many villagers have stories like that where Unibrow was able to save the day.
