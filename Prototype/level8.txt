*PRE-INTRO*:
Royal Doctor: “You performed admirably at the Radiation River. We are getting closer to Count Leukemia’s lair - I can feel it! But first we must visit the Transplant Tundra.”


*INTRO*:
“The entire Tundra has been infected by Leukemia’s minions but we can save the land by planting a cure: bone marrow. In this game, you must get the bone marrow to the bottom of the screen in order to cure the village. ”



**Doctor will Introduce Himself Here*



*CADEUCES*:
A bone marrow transplant basically swaps out your “bad” blood cells that aren’t working for “good” ones that can do their job. These new cells will go to the bone marrow where they can create new cells that work properly. First, the doctor will connect you to a monitor that tracks your heart and other important information about your body. You might also take some premedicine that helps with nausea and helps your body accept the new cells. Next, the new “good” cells will be put into your body using your Central Line. The medicine you take before can sometimes make you sleepy so you might sleep through your transplant. You might feel a bit nauseous or form a funny taste in your mouth, but this is all normal.
