Royal Doctor: “Now that your body is fit enough, I must ensure that your mind is healthy as well. This journey has been long and difficult, but mental health is just as important as physical health. Only when both our mind and body are at their bests can we truly be successful against Count Leukemia. The psychologists here in the Healing Harbor can help you develop the right tools to understand the many thoughts and emotions you may have. ”

*CADEUCES*:
It might feel like your life is out of your control right now. Doctors keep telling you information, you feel sick, and nothing seems to be making much sense. It is important for you to know that your cancer is not your fault - you did nothing to cause this bad thing to happen.

During this process, you will have to go to many doctor’s appointments, take many medications, and spend time in the hospital. You might have to spend time away from school and your friends, you might lose some of your hair, and this all may cause you to feel different emotions. You might feel lonely, angry, sad, lost, or afraid, but all of these emotions are normal. If you feel these emotions or any others, we encourage you to talk about it. Oftentimes, your worries are far scarier than the reality, so don’t be afraid to talk about your fears.
