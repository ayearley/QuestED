*INTRO*:
“It is important that we monitor your health during this journey. We will do this using one of my inventions, a Central Line. As you proceed through the kingdom, this magical tube will deliver health boosters and medicines directly to your heart during each level. Don’t worry, I’ll give you this potion to make you sleep before I put it in place so you won’t feel a thing...”



**Doctor will Introduce Himself Here*



*CADEUCES*:
Often times when you take medicine, you can just drink your medicine or take a pill. Other medicines that you need require the doctor to put the medicine directly into your body, through a tube called a central line. The doctor will put you to sleep so you will not feel any pain, but when you wake up you will have a central line in place coming from your chest. This will stay in you throughout the course of treatment and it is important to keep clean. If your skin gets hot or itchy, tell your doctor!
