*PRE-INTRO*:
Before I can prepare you to defend the Count Leukemia and save our great lands, it is first important that you learn about what has come over our great kingdom so you are best equipped to be our hero

*INTRO*:
How did Count Leukemia get power you may find yourself asking because he had been banished by his mom and dad years ago. He was always searching for ways to become a ruler of Panacea. Count Leukemia would take good workers of the kingdom and tell them that they should not longer work for the King and Queen but should work for him. He would promise them a better life with a large house in the kingdom, with good land, and lots of their favorite luxuries. Many of these workers were not convinced by this at first because they really enjoyed their lives that they lived under the King and Queen. Eventually, with enough time, Count Leukemia was able to convert these good workers into his own minions. They make up the blood cell minions, and right now they are causing our villagers to feel sick. It is our job to get rid of these minions in our land and restore them to the good, kind people that they were. If we can do that, then people will feel better.
