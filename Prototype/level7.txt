*PRE-INTRO*:
Royal Doctor Voiceover “Good work helping the villagers in the Woodlands of the White Blood Cells. Let’s now begin our journey. Now on to chemotherapy Canyon!


*INTRO*:
We’ve heard that Count Leukemia’s minions have assembled and are terrorizing the commoners.  Let’s help free them! In this game, you will spray poison on the minions shaped like cancer cells - make sure you avoid the white blood cell trees. 


**Doctor will Introduce Himself Here*



*CADEUCES*:
Chemotherapy is used to stop the growth of cancer cells in your body so that you can feel better. You’ll get chemotherapy on a schedule, so you’ll have to keep receiving treatment until your doctor says you’re done. Chemotherapy will make you feel sick because it stops the growth of cancer cells, but also normal cells in your body. You might feel nauseous, lose your appetite, get sores in your mouth and stomach, and will start to lose some of your hair. Even though it feels like you’re getting sicker, these symptoms are proof that the chemotherapy is doing its job and trying to make you feel better in the long run.
